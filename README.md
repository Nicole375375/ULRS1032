==================================================================================================================================

💁🏻‍♀️ 𝓒𝓸𝓾𝓻𝓼𝓮 𝓼𝔂𝓷𝓸𝓹𝓼𝓲𝓼 💁🏻‍♀️

Digital electronics is the foundation of all microprocessor-based systems found in computers,
robots, automobiles, and industrial control systems. This course introduces the students to digital
electronics and provides a broad overview of many important concepts, components, and tools.
Students will get up-to-date coverage of digital fundamentals-from basic concepts to
programmable logic devices. Laboratory experiments provide hands-on experience with the
simulator software, actual devices and circuits studied in the classroom

📌𝓡𝓮𝓯𝓵𝓮𝓬𝓽𝓲𝓸𝓷📌

This course covered essential topics like numbering systems, logic gates, Boolean algebra, and the design of both combinational and sequential circuits. Through the labs that were conducted during class, it provided me a hands-on chance to do the connection of logic gates and how to use and simulate the circuit using the DEEDS application. I really appreciate that labs are conducted since they are very useful for understanding the topics. Our lecturer also gives a good explanation for all the topics. By the end of the course, I gained the skills to design and implement digital circuits for practical problems, which has significantly enhanced my problem-solving abilities and confidence in working with microprocessor-based systems.
